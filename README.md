### Stock price predcition
In this project, I have worked with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company. A mix of machine learning algorithms are implemented to predict the future stock price of this company, starting with simple algorithms like averaging and linear regression, and then move on to advanced techniques like Auto ARIMA and LSTM.
